Things to implement:

- student recognition (greeting as they log in)
- Logout button
- advisor appointment viewing ( halfway done, needs table to be added for appointment details)
- advisor passwords 
- calendar buttons and refreshing (for some reason the calendar will not show up on the refreshed student scheduler) it takes two presses to on any button to change page
